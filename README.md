# Leaflet - Visualizing Data with Leaflet


### Visualization of Earthquake data from USGS

All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days data available at [USGS GeoJSON Feed](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) page was used for this vizualization.

* A map was developed using Leaflet. Leaflet plots all of the earthquakes from your data set based on their longitude and latitude.

* The markers in the map reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and depth of the earth quake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger and earthquakes with greater depth appear darker in color.

*  A popup that provides the magnitude and the location of the earthquake is available when the marker is clicked.

* Create a legend that will provide context for your map data.

## Background

Welcome to the United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short! The USGS is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment; and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes. As a new hire, you will be helping them out with an exciting new project!
